Python package to integrate orbits of stellar halo tracers on a MW time-dependent potential that includes the LMC.
The time-dependent potential use the Basis Field Expansions formalism.

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.com/jngaravitoc/BFE_integrator.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jngaravitoc/BFE_integrator)


## To-do:

- Fix Travis issues
- Implement Classes
- Think of other integrator to use besided Leapfrog.
- Code should work also in parallel.
- Code should be flexible to integrate many orbits at the same time.
